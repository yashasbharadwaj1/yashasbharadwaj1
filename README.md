I am Yashas A. Bharadwaj, a recent graduate with a B.Tech in Information Science Technology (May 2023). I am writing to provide a summary of my professional experience and the skills I have developed, which I believe would be of interest to your organization.

From January 2023 to May 2023, I worked as a Django Developer Intern, where I gained hands-on experience in web development. Following this, I served as a Junior Python Backend Developer at an AI startup, GetOdin.ai, from May 2023 to January 2024. During this role, I wrote APIs using FastAPI, developed several bots for team efficiency, and handled deployment and New Relic integration for logging. Unfortunately, due to organizational restructuring, I was laid off in January 2024.

Since February 2024, I have been deeply interested in the field of data science. I have pursued extensive training and certification in key data tools and technologies:

1. **SQL**: Completed an in-depth SQL course by Ankit Bansal, earning certification and conducting case studies on public datasets.
2. **MS-Excel**: Finished a comprehensive MS-Excel course from Codebasics, earning certification. I have used pivot tables to build Profit and Loss statements, performance reports, and quarterly analyses.
3. **Power BI**: Currently completing an extensive Power BI course from Codebasics (80% finished). I have built multiple views for finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain as part of the coursework.
4. **Apache Spark**: Enrolled in an in-depth Spark course by Data Vidya, where I built an ETL pipeline on Azure. I am currently involved in building projects using Spark, SQL, and Power BI.

I am enthusiastic about applying my backend development experience and newly acquired data skills to contribute effectively to your team. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and certifications align with the needs of your organization.
