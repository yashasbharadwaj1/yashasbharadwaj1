I am Yashas A. Bharadwaj, a recent graduate with a B.Tech in Information Science Technology (May 2023). I am writing to provide a summary of my professional experience and the skills I have developed

From January 2023 to May 2023, I worked as a Django Developer Intern, where I gained hands-on experience in web development. Following this, I served as a Junior Python Backend Developer at an AI startup, GetOdin.ai, from May 2023 to January 2024. During this role, I wrote APIs using FastAPI, developed several bots for team efficiency, and handled deployment and New Relic integration for logging. Unfortunately, due to organizational restructuring, I was laid off in January 2024.

Since February 2024, I have been deeply interested in the field of data science. I have pursued extensive training and certification in key data tools and technologies:

1. **SQL**
2. **MS-Excel**
3. **Power BI**
4. **Apache Spark**
5. **Automation Testing**

I am enthusiastic about applying my backend development experience and newly acquired data skills to contribute effectively to your team. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and certifications align with the needs of your organization.
